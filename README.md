## How to update the diagrams

The diagrams are generated by [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/), to update them, just edit the `.puml` files on _diagrams_ folder and generate a new diagram using this VsCode [Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml) following. Then put the files on the _static/img/diagrams_ folder following the folder pattern.
  
- Tip: edit the settings.json file to generate the SVG diagrams on the _static/img/diagrams_ folder. Just add this lines to the file:

  ```json
  "plantuml.exportFormat": "svg",
  "plantuml.exportOutDir": "static/img",
  ```
